9. Palindrome Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

/*
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(log10(n)). We divided the input by 10 for every iteration, so the time complexity is O(log10(n))

Space complexity : O(1).
